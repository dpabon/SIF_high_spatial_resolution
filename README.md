#  SIF-based high spatial resolution GPP flux estimations

satellite EO downscaling tool powered by YAXArrays.jl and Julia.

## How to use it:

Currently the method to downscale SIF proposed by Duveiller and Cescatti (2016) is implemented in [bin/julia/duveiller_2016/first_implementation.jl](bin/julia/duveiller_2016/first_implementation.jl).
